#Science on GitHub

As an accompaniment to my article on researchers using GitHub to store data, we have 
compiled this list of projects as a table of comma-separated values (a CSV file). Feel free to suggest others via pull request. Or, to edit the file directly in GitHub, click file ("Science on GitHub.csv"), then click the pencil icon in the toolbar at the upper right.
