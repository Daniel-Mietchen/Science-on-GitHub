#Science on GitHub

As an accompaniment to Jeffrey Perkel's <a href=http://www.nature.com/news/democratic-databases-science-on-github-1.20719>article</a> for Nature on researchers using GitHub to store data, we have compiled this list of projects as a table of comma-separated values (a CSV file). To view the file, just click the link ("Science on GitHub.csv).

Feel free to suggest others via the issues tab at the top of the page. Or, to suggest changes directly in GitHub, click file, then click the pencil icon in the toolbar at the upper right. When you're done, click "commit changes" at the bottom of the page.

To get a sense of how GitHub tracks changes, click the file "README.md", and click the History button in the toolbar. Each line represents a single change to that file. If you click the specific commit identifier at the right of a given line (eg: <a href=https://github.com/jperkel/Science-on-GitHub/commit/7135e431aabb18b905ea2d5e8b4b5385a9006df5>7135e43</a>), you can view exactly what that change entailed. Lines highlighted in green are additions, while lines in red have been deleted.
